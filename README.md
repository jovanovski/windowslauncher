# Windows Launcher for Android

This is a Windows inspired launcher for Android 11+, which tries to faithfully recreate the retro Windows on modern phones. Feel free to grab a pre-comliped APK from the Releases tab or download and build the project yourself.

### Notes
1) Claude Code was used to create most of this as a fun side-project of mine. Do **NOT** expect super clean code or great organization, it was never the goal. Feel free to refactor things that need refactoring, and submit a PR if something is bothering you.
2) I claim **NO** copyright over any of the assets used in this project. Most of them belong to Microsoft, and there is no goal to do anything illegal with them. This is just a nostalgia project for all us old Windows fans.
